### Workbooks

#### a) Rainfall

Load raw, historic monthly rainfall data for a number of stations in the powerstation catchment and prepare summary statistics for presentation of rainfall patterns.

*Rain Year* is defined as running Jul to Jun so that peak rainfall sits in the middle of the period.

#### b) Ngonye Falls Synthetic Historic Flow Series

To produce a long time series (1924-2017) of daily flow for the Ngonye Falls site, a correlation is carried out between the overlapping portions of the *Zambezi River Authority* (ZRA) gauge at Ngonye Falls and portion of the record of the Victoria Falls gauge (2005-2016).

Once correlated, the full Victoria Falls gauge record is extrapolated to produce a synthetic record for Ngonye Falls.

#### c) Ngonye Falls Flow Analysis

Load the synthetic historic daily flow series for Ngonye and produce various summary statistics for later presentation.

#### d) Setup Environmental Flow Requirements

Calculated Environmental Flow exceedance percentiles for each day of the historic flow series. These are used later to determine environmental flows.

#### e) Power & Energy

Calculates power and energy output from the power station for daily river flow data depending on parameters given in a model file.

#### f) Ngonye Falls Power and Energy Periods
Produces summary, agrregated results from the daily power and energy modelling.

#### g) Ngonye Falls Power and Energy Periods
Produces 'simulations' of station operation over two periods, debt period and equity period. Each simulation has a different start date on the historic series.
