    <h3>Workbooks</h3>

    <h4>a) Rainfall</h4>

<p>Load raw, historic monthly rainfall data for a number of stations in the powerstation catchment and prepare summary statistics for presentation of rainfall patterns.</p>

<p>*Rain Year* is defined as running Jul to Jun so that peak rainfall sits in the middle of the period.</p>

<h4>b) Ngonye Falls Synthetic Historic Flow Series</h4>

<p>To produce a long time series (1924-2017) of daily flow for the Ngonye Falls site, a correlation is carried out between the overlapping portions of the *Zambezi River Authority* (ZRA) gauge at Ngonye Falls and portion of the record of the Victoria Falls gauge (2005-2016).</p>

<p>Once correlated, the full Victoria Falls gauge record is extrapolated to produce a synthetic record for Ngonye Falls.</p>

<h4>c) Ngonye Falls Flow Analysis</h4>

<p>Load the synthetic historic daily flow series for Ngonye and produce various summary statistics for later presentation.</p>

<h4>d) Setup Environmental Flow Requirements</h4>

<p>Calculated Environmental Flow exceedance percentiles for each day of the historic flow series. These are used later to determine environmental flows.</p>

<h4>e) Power & Energy</h4>

<p>Calculates power and energy output from the power station for daily river flow data depending on parameters given in a model file.</p>

<h4>f) Ngonye Falls Power and Energy Periods</h4>
<p>Produces summary, agrregated results from the daily power and energy modelling.</p>

<h4>g) Ngonye Falls Power and Energy Periods</h4>
<p>Produces 'simulations' of station operation over two periods, debt period and equity period. Each simulation has a different start date on the historic series. </p>
